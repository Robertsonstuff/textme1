A simple affirmation app that sends a message to my phone repetitively every 15 seconds, Why!? because I can! ;)
This has taken me a long time to get to a full working project actually working, I'm only new to my coding journey.
This hasn't been simple or easy in anyway, but I'm hooked!

I was under the impression that if I write some simple code in python and then drag and drop the file to a server, job done! Oh dear, how wrong was I!!

The way I understand my code and how it works so far: 
1)Create a virtual environment on your computer (I use powershell and Windows OS) 
2)Pip install necessary modules needed to keep your code functional and precise 
3)Write code in python 
4)Decide what server you are going to upload it to (In my case it's heroku) 
5)Attach your necessary files to accompany your python code to tell your server how to read your code(runtime.txt, Procfile, requirements.txt). 
6)Push these files to a git repository or github (heroku allows you to use either) for your server to receive your files. 
7)Add and adjust environment variables to your server (heroku in my case) for sensitive information. 
8)Turn on your dynos on your server to activate the server to read your code. This switch is essentially an on switch for your code to work. 
9)Sit back, relax and marvel of how much of a genius you are because you've just automated a teenie, tiny part of your day-to-day life.

If you don't know what these steps mean, that's ok, I didn't either, but please understand that this what makes my code run and if I can figure it out, you can too!!
